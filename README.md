1. The platform sometimes (randomly, with a chance 15%) catches the ball instead of deflecting it. The player is able to choose the direction and shoot on the left mouse button.

2. Orange blocks explode on being hit. Explosions destroy nearest (all directly and diagonally adjacent) blocks as well. You can use any color which you want.

3. Abilities are dropped after every 10th block destroyed. A random ability is spawned in the position of a destroyed block. Every ability has a collision, so it can fall down if there is no block below. The player should “catch” the ability with the platform.
